# Sloane Lab NHM Parser

This repository contains the parser that is used to import data from the NHM Data Atlas into the [Sloane Lab](http://sloanelab.org/) knowledge base.

The main code of the parser is in the Jupyter notebook NHM_CSV_to_RDF. The following libraries are required:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), to manipulate and analyse the data

The XML catalogues are stored in the [data](https://github.com/sloanelab-org/xml-parser/tree/main/data) directory, and include 10 NHM datasets that have been ingested into the Sloane Lab Knowledge Base.
